# SpykesML
## Machine Learning methods implemented as encoding models
This repository accompanies "Modern Machine Learning Far Outperforms GLMs at Predicting Spikes"[https://doi.org/10.1101/111450]. We implement various Machine Learning algorithms for spike prediction and offer this as a Python template.

The meat of this is in a Jupyter notebook. To run yourself, simply clone this repository and open the notebook in Jupyter.

For ML algorithms applied to decoding, see our partner repository Neural_Decoding, also on the main KordingLab GitHub page.
