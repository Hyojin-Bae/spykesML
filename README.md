# SpykesML
## Machine Learning methods implemented as encoding models
This repository accompanies "Modern Machine Learning Far Outperforms GLMs at Predicting Spikes". We implement various Machine Learning algorithms for spike prediction and offer this as a Python template. 

The meat of this is in a Jupyter notebook. To run yourself, simply clone this repository and open the notebook in Jupyter.


### Dependencies
#### Basics
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - scipy
 - matplotlib

#### Methods
 - sklearn
 - pyglmnet (glm)
 - xgboost
